🚀 Sales Funnel Optimization in EdTech
📈 Uncovering revenue drivers and drop-off patterns across Lead Owner cohorts

❗ Problem Overview
Despite a large inflow of leads, 🚫 40% of Lead Owners generate no revenue, signaling a major performance gap.
Key inefficiencies identified:

🕒 Delayed contact attempts — Non-Revenue Generating (Non-RG) Lead Owners take over 24 hours, vs just 3 hours by Revenue Generating (RG) owners.

🎯 Demo leakage — Only 50% of booked demos are completed.

📉 53% drop-off at Main Stage due to non-contact, particularly among Non-RG owners.

📊 Certain Team Leaders consistently underperform, leading to missed conversion opportunities and poor ROI.
